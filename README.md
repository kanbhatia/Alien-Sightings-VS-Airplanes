# Alien-Sightings-VS-Airplanes

The visiting of extraterrestrial beings has been a subject of popular debate for over a
century. When the Soviet Union first launched Sputnik into orbit the inevitable question
followed: If we can reach space, why can’t beings from other planets do the same? This began a
period of numerous unexplained phenomenon the most common of which is the sighting
of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO’s) which many have attributed to the visiting of earth
by Aliens. While it is not possible to prove that these sightings are in fact Aliens we can
explore if they have more world-bound explanations. The most obvious explanation for
these UFOs is that the witnesses have mistaken human aircrafts for something they
did not recognize. It is this theory that we explore in-depth, by comparing various
markers of flight activity with the sighting of UFOs.
