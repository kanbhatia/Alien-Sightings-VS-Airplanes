# Alien-Sightings-VS-Airplanes

The visiting of extraterrestrial beings has been a subject of popular debate for over a
century. When the Soviet Union first launched Sputnik into orbit the inevitable question
followed: If we can reach space, why can’t beings from other planets do the same? This began a
period of numerous unexplained phenomenon the most common of which is the sighting
of Unidentified Flying Object (UFO’s) which many have attributed to the visiting of earth
by Aliens. While it is not possible to prove that these sightings are in fact Aliens we can
explore if they have more world-bound explanations. The most obvious explanation for
these UFOs is that the witnesses have mistaken human aircrafts for something they
did not recognize. It is this theory that we explore in-depth, by comparing various
markers of flight activity with the sighting of UFOs.

The Figure above shows a heatmap of the sightings in Ontario. The markers represent
the locations of Ontario’s most popular airports. We can see that there is a clear correlation as
the sightings cluster around airports. The sightings are also mostly seen in southern Ontario.
This is because of higher densities of population and airports. We can make this correlation
because we assume airport placements and airport density are in direct relation to population
density.

In the Figure above, A heatmap of departures per airport (black and blue) was placed on
top of the UFO sightings heatmap. The weight placed was based on the log scale of the
departures per airport. This was done to normalise the data. While Toronto and Ottawa see
close to 3,000,000 and 1,600,000 departures respectively, most of the other airports see less
than 50,000 a year. Looking at Ottawa and Toronto we can see that there are a lot of departures
and a lot of sightings as well. There are however other locations such as Thunder Bay where
they experience many UFO sightings but not as many airport departures. Here we do not see a
correlation between the number of airport departures and alien sightings.

This graph does not show a clear answer to if you are closer to the airport, you most likely saw
an airplane. The largest number of sightings were between 25-35KM away from the airport. It
may be a possibility to say that an airplane looks more like a UFO at this range and if you were
closer to the airport, you would know it is an airplane. The third largest amount of sightings are
0-5KM away from the airport which is worth mentioning. In general, there is no clear
relationship between airport distance and sighting.
